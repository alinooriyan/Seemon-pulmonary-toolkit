# Supported data and imaging formats

PTK is primarily designed to work with 3D CT and MRI images covering the whole lung.

You may be able to load and visualise other data into PTK, but you may find the segmentation and other Plugins do not work.

##Â Data not covering the whole lung

The PTK algorithms work best when the 3D volume covers the entire lung. There are adjustment mechanisms in place which allow for lung boundaries to extend outside the image in some cases, although this could result in inaccurate measurements such as for lung volume.

## Non-lung data

If you want to work on non-lung images, you might consider using the provided MIV (Medical Imaging Viewer), which is similar to PTK but is not lung-specific.

## Supported data formats

### DICOM

PTK uses [DicomMat](https://github.com/tomdoel/dicomat) to group DICOM images into Datasets. This allows PTK to separate out scout or report images from the core image files, and to separate non-contiguous datasets.

### MetaIO

MetaIO files are usually a single `.mha` file, or a pair of files eg. `.mhd` & `.raw`. If
